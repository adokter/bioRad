\title{Calculate vertical radiation profile}
\usage{
beam_profile(height, distance, elev, antenna = 0, beam_angle = 1,
  k = 4/3, lat = 35, re = 6378, rp = 6357)
}
\arguments{
\item{height}{numeric. Height in meter.}

\item{distance}{numeric. Distance from the radar as measured along sea level (down range) in m.}

\item{elev}{numeric vector. Beam elevation(s) in degrees.}

\item{antenna}{numeric. Height of the centre of the radar antenna in meters}

\item{beam_angle}{numeric. Beam opening angle in degrees, typically the
angle between the half-power (-3 dB) points of the main lobe}

\item{k}{Standard refraction coefficient.}

\item{lat}{Geodetic latitude of the radar in degrees.}

\item{re}{Earth equatorial radius in km.}

\item{rp}{Earth polar radius in km.}
}
\value{
numeric vector. Normalized radiated energy at each of the specified
  heights.
}
\description{
Calculate for a set of beam elevations elev
the altitudinal normalized distribution of radiated energy by those beams.
}
\details{
Beam profile is calculated using \link{beam_height} and
  \link{beam_width}. Returns a beam profile as a function of height relative
  to ground level.

  Returns the normalized altitudinal pattern of radiated energy as a function
  of altitude at a given distance from the radar, assuming the beams are
  emitted at antenna level.
