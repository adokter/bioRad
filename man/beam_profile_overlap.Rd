\description{
Calculates the distribution overlap between a vertical profile ('vp')
and the vertical radiation profile of a set of emitted radar beams
at various elevation angles as given by \link{beam_profile}.
}
\details{
Overlap is calculated as the  [Bhattacharyya coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhattacharyya_distance)
(i.e. distribution overlap) between the (normalized) vertical profile vp and the (normalized)
radiation coverage pattern as calculated by \link{beam_profile}.

The current implementation does not (yet) take into account the system noise floor when calculating
the overlap.

In the ODIM data model the attribute \code{/how/NEZ} or \code{/how/NEZH} specifies the system noise floor
(the Noise Equivalent Z or noise equivalent reflectivity factor. the H refers to the horizontal channel
of a dual-polarization radar).
In addition, the attribute \code{/how/LOG} gives "security distance above mean noise level (dB) threshold value".
This is equivalent to the log receiver signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. the dB above the noise floor for the signal processor
to report a valid reflectivity value. We recommend using \code{NEZH}+\code{LOG} for \code{noise_floor}, as this
is the effective noise floor of the system below which no data will be reported by the radar signal processor.

Typical values are \code{NEZH} = -45 to -50 dBZ at 1 km from the radar. \code{LOG} is typically around 1 dB.

Need to evaluate beam by beam the returned signal relative to a uniform beam filling of at least NEZH + LOG
If returned signal is lower, the gate is below noise level.
