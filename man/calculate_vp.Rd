\arguments{
\item{vol.in}{A radar file containing a radar polar volume, either in
\href{https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird/blob/master/doc/OPERA2014_O4_ODIM_H5-v2.2.pdf}{ODIM}
format, which is the implementation of the OPERA data information model in
\href{https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/}{HDF5} format, or a format
supported by the
\href{http://trmm-fc.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_gv/software/rsl/}{RSL library}.}

\item{vp.out}{character. Filename for the vertical profile to be
generated in ODIM HDF5 format (optional).}

\item{vol.out}{character. Filename for the polar volume to be
generated in ODIM HDF5 format (optional, e.g. for converting RSL formats
to ODIM).}

\item{autoconf}{logical. When TRUE, default optimal configuration settings
are selected automatically, and other user settings are ignored.}

\item{verbose}{logical. When TRUE, pipe Docker stdout to R console. On
Windows always TRUE.}

\item{mount}{character. String with the mount point (a directory path) for
the Docker container.}

\item{sd_vvp}{numeric. Lower threshold in radial velocity standard
deviation (\code{sd_vvp}) in m/s.}

\item{rcs}{numeric. Radar cross section per bird in cm^2.}

\item{dualpol}{logical. When \code{TRUE} use dual-pol mode, in which
meteorological echoes are filtered using the correlation coefficient
\code{rhohv}. When \code{FALSE} use single polarization mode based only
on reflectivity and radial velocity quantities.}

\item{rhohv}{numeric. Lower threshold in correlation coefficient used to
filter meteorological scattering.}

\item{elev.min}{numeric. Minimum scan elevation in degrees.}

\item{elev.max}{numeric. Maximum scan elevation in degrees.}

\item{range.max}{numeric. Maximum range in km.}

\item{nlayer}{numeric. Number of altitude layers in the profile.}

\item{hlayer}{numeric. Width of altitude layers in metre.}

\item{dealias}{logical. Whether to dealias radial velocities; this should
typically be done when the scans in the polar volume have low Nyquist
velocities (below 25 m/s).}

\item{nyquist.min}{numeric. Minimum Nyquist velocity of scans in m/s for
scans to be included in the analysis.}

defined, output files \code{vp.out} and \code{vol.out} are saved to disk.

Calculates a vertical profile of birds (vp) from a polar volume (pvol).

\details{
Requires a running \href{https://www.docker.com/}{Docker} daemon.

Common arguments set by users are \code{vol.in}, \code{vp.out},
\code{autoconf} and \code{mount}.

Turn on \code{autoconf} to automatically select the optimal parameters for a
given radar file. The default for C-band data is to apply rain-filtering in
single polarization mode, as well as dual polarization mode when available.

The default for S-band data is to apply precipitation filtering in
dual-polarization mode.

Arguments that sometimes require non-default values are: \code{rcs},
\code{sd_vvp}, \code{range.max}, \code{dualpol}, \code{dealias}.

Other arguments are typically left at their defaults.

\code{azim.min} and \code{azim.max} only affects reflectivity-derived
estimates in the profile (DBZH,eta,dens), not radial-velocity derived
estimates (u, v, w, ff, dd, sd_vvp), which are estimated on all azimuths at
all times. \code{azim.min}, \code{azim.max} may be set to exclude an angular
sector with high ground clutter.

\code{range.max} may be extended up to 40,000 m for volumes with low
elevations only, in order to extend coverage to higher altitudes.

For altitude layers with a VVP-retrieved radial velocity standard deviation
value below the threshold \code{sd_vvp}, the bird density \code{dens} is set
to zero (see vertical profile \link[=summary.vp]{vp} class). This threshold
might be dependent on radar processing settings. Results from validation
campaigns so far indicate that 2 m/s is the best choice for this parameter
for most weather radars.
The algorithm has been tested and developed for altitude layers with
\code{hlayer} = 200 m. Smaller widths are not recommended as they may cause
instabilities of the volume velocity profiling (VVP) and dealiasing routines,
and effectively lead to pseudo-replicated altitude data, since altitudinal
patterns smaller than the beam width cannot be resolved.

The default radar cross section (11 cm^2) corresponds to the average value
found by Dokter et al. in a calibration campaign of a full migration autumn
season in western Europe at C-band. It's value may depend on radar
wavelength. \code{rcs} will scale approximately \eqn{M^{2/3}} with \code{M}
the bird's mass.

Using default values of \code{range.min} and \code{range.max} is
recommended. Ranges closer than 5 km tend to be contaminated by ground
clutter, while range gates beyond 25 km become too wide to resolve the
default altitude layer width of 200 metre (see \link{beam_width}).

For dealiasing, the torus mapping method by Haase et al. is used.

At S-band (radar wavelength ~ 10 cm), currently only \code{dualpol=T} mode
is recommended.

On repeated calls of \code{calculate_vp}, the Docker container mount can be
recycled from one call to the next if subsequent calls share the same
\code{mount} argument. Re-mounting a Docker container takes time, therefore
it is advised to choose a mountpoint that is a parent directory of all
volume files to be processed, such that \code{calculate_vp} calls are as fast
as possible.
