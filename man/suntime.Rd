\usage{
suntime(lon, lat, date, elev = -0.268, rise = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lon}{longitude in decimal degrees}

\item{lat}{latitude in decimal degrees}

\item{date}{date inhereting from class "\code{POSIXt}" or a string interpretable by \link[base]{as.Date}}

\item{elev}{sun elevation in degrees}

\item{rise}{whether to output for rising or setting sun}
}
\value{
the moment of sunrise or sunset in UTC time
}
\description{
Calculate sunrise and sunset
}
\details{
The angular diameter of the sun is about 0.536 degrees, therefore the moment
of sunrise/sunset corresponds to half that elevation at -0.268 degrees.

Note that for a given date and location, sunrise time can be after sunset time, depending
on the time difference between the local time and the UTC time zone.

Approximate astronomical formula are used, therefore the moment of sunrise / sunset may
be off by a few minutes

\examples{
# sunrise in the Netherlands
suntime(5,53,"2016-01-01")
# sunset in the Netherlands
suntime(5,53,"2016-01-01",rise=FALSE)
# civil twilight in Ithaca, NY, today
suntime(-76.5,42.4,Sys.time(),elev=-6)
