\arguments{
\item{range}{numeric. Range (distance from the radar antenna) in km.}

\item{elev}{numeric. Elevation in degrees.}

\item{k}{Standard refraction coefficient.}

\item{lat}{Geodetic latitude in degrees.}

\item{re}{Earth equatorial radius in km.}

\item{rp}{Earth polar radius in km.}
}
\value{
numeric. Beam height in km.
}
\description{
Calculates the height of a radar beam as a function of elevation and range,
assuming the beam is emitted at surface level.
}
\details{
To account for refraction of the beam towards the earth's surface,
an effective earth's radius of 4/3 * (true radius) is assumed.

The earth's radius is approximated as a point on a spheroid surface, with
\code{re} the longer equatorial radius, and \code{rp} the shorter polar
radius. Typically uncertainties in refraction coefficient are relatively
large, making oblateness of the earth and the dependence of earth radius with
latitude only a small correction. Using default values assumes an average
earth's radius of 6371 km.
