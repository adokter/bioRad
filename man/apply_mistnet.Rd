\usage{
apply_mistnet(
  file,
  pvolfile_out,
  verbose = FALSE,
  mount = dirname(file),
  load = TRUE,
  mistnet_elevations = c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5),
  local_install,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Character. Path to a polar volume (\code{pvol}) file.}

\item{pvolfile_out}{Character. (optional) File name. When provided, writes a
polar volume (\code{pvol}) file to disk that includes the Mistnet segmentation
results.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. When \code{TRUE}, vol2bird \code{stdout} is piped to the R
console.}

\item{mount}{Character. Directory path of the mount point for the Docker
container (deprecated).}

\item{load}{Logical. When \code{TRUE}, returns a \code{pvol} object.}

\item{mistnet_elevations}{Numeric vector of length 5. Elevation angles to
feed to the MistNet segmentation model, which expects exactly 5 elevation
scans at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 degrees. Specifying different elevation
angles may compromise segmentation results.}

\item{local_install}{(deprecated) Character. Path to local vol2bird installation (e.g.
\code{your/vol2bird_install_directory/vol2bird/bin/vol2bird}) to use instead of
the Docker container.}

\item{local_mistnet}{Character. Path to local MistNet segmentation model in
PyTorch format (e.g. \verb{/your/path/mistnet_nexrad.pt}) to use.}
}
\value{
When \code{load} is \code{TRUE}, a polar volume (\code{pvol}) object with the
Mistnet segmentation results. When \code{load} is \code{FALSE}, \code{TRUE} on success.
}
\description{
Applies the MistNet segmentation model to a polar volume file on disk and
loads the resultant segmentation as a polar volume (\code{pvol}) object.

\details{
MistNet (Lin et al. 2019) is a deep convolutional neural network that has
been trained using labels derived from S-band dual-polarization data across
the US NEXRAD network. Its purpose is to screen out areas of precipitation in
weather radar data, primarily legacy data for which dual-polarization data
are not available. Because the network has been trained on S-band data, it
may not perform as well on C-band.

MistNet requires three single-polarization parameters as input: reflectivity
(\code{DBZH}), radial velocity (\code{VRADH}), and spectrum width (\code{WRADH}), at 5
specific elevation angles (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 degrees). Based on
these data it can estimate a segmentation mask that identifies pixels with
weather that should be removed when interested in biological data only.

MistNet will calculate three class probabilities (from 0 to 1, with 1
corresponding to a 100\% probability) as additional scan parameters to the
polar volume:
\itemize{
\item \code{BACKGROUND}: Class probability that no signal was detected above the noise
level of the radar.
\item \code{WEATHER}: Class probability that weather was detected.
\item \code{BIOLOGY}: Class probability that biological scatterers were detected.
}

MistNet will calculate three class probabilities (from 0 to 1, with 1 corresponding
to a 100\% probability) as additional scan parameters to the polar volume:
\itemize{
\item \code{BACKGROUND}: Class probability that no signal was detected above the noise
level of the radar
\item \code{WEATHER}: Class probability that weather was detected
\item \code{BIOLOGY}: Class probability that biological scatterers were detected
}

These class probabilities are only available for the 5 input elevations used
as input for the MistNet model. Based on all the class probabilities a final
weather segmentation map is calculated, stored as scan parameter \code{CELL},
which is available for all elevation scans.
\itemize{
\item \code{CELL}: Final weather segmentation, with values > 1 indicating pixels
classified as weather and values equal to 1 indicating pixels that are
located within 5 km distance of a weather pixels.
}

A pixel is classified as weather if the class probability \code{WEATHER} > 0.45 or
when the average class probability for rain across all five MistNet elevation
scans at that spatial location > 0.45.

MistNet may run more slowly on Windows than on Linux or Mac OS X.
