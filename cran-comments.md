## bioRad 0.7.1 

Addresses all CRAN instructions from the recent 0.7.1 submission:

1. added value tags to rcs-set.Rd and sd_vvp_threshold-set.Rd
2. removed commented example in read_vpfiles.Rd.
3. We could not find a commented example in c.vp.Rd as mentioned by the reviewer, since this function did not have an example. We have added an example now.
4. changed dontrun{} example in apply_mistnet to donttest{}, and prevent write in user home directory

This package will be used extensively in a summer training school next week (Jul 16 - Jul 21), we would greatly appreciate it being restored on CRAN as soon as possible.
